# Random Forest Implementation

Libraries Used:
1. pandas
2. numpy
3. matplotlib
4. seaborn
5. sklearn - StandardScaler, train_test_split, RandomForestClassifier, metrics
6. warnings

Random Forest was found to be the only model which gave near high accuracy even without any parameter tuning. The final accuracy came out to be very near to the one which we obtained 
without hypertuning. The accuracy showed very less deviation. This ML model was found to be a very good start for predicting accurate results without having the necessity of 
tuning to obtain higher accuracy and metric scores.

The result obtained was:

| Algorithm      | Testing Accuracy | Precision      | Recall         | Specificity    |
|     :---:      |     :---:        |      :---:     |     :---:      |      :---:     | 
| RF             |     96.875       |        93.846  | 96.825         |     96.296     |
