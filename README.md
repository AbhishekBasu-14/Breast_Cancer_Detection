# Breast_Cancer_Detection
Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data

This is the course project of Open Source Technology and Communication Lab (OSTCL) during our 5th Semester of Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering. The project compares accuracy of 5 Machine Learning Models that were implemented to predict the breast cancer stage - Benign or Malignant. The 5 ML approaches are as follows:
1. CNN
2. Random Forest
3. Logistic Regression
4. SVM
5. kNN

Models were trained after data pre-processing and feature selection using a correlation heatmap. Hypertuning of parameters was done in order to increase the accuracy of each model.

The important libraries used are as follows:
1. keras
2. tensorflow
3. sklearn
4. numpy
5. pandas
6. matplotlib
7. seaborn

The results are as follows:
